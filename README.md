# TextDelta

Elixir counter-part for the Quill.js [Delta](https://quilljs.com/docs/delta/)
library. It provides a baseline for [Operational
Transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_transformation) of
rich text.

Here's Delta pitch from the [Delta.js repository](https://github.com/quilljs/delta):

> Deltas are a simple, yet expressive format that can be used to describe contents and changes. The format is JSON based, and is human readable, yet easily parsible by machines. Deltas can describe any rich text document, includes all text and formatting information, without the ambiguity and complexity of HTML.
>
> A Delta is made up of an Array of Operations, which describe changes to a document. They can be an insert, delete or retain. Note operations do not take an index. They always describe the change at the current index. Use retains to "keep" or "skip" certain parts of the document.
>
> Donâ€™t be confused by its name Deltaâ€”Deltas represents both documents and changes to documents. If you think of Deltas as the instructions from going from one document to another, the way Deltas represent a document is by expressing the instructions starting from an empty document.

More information on original Delta format can be found

Operational Transformation is likely [this

## Acknowledments

This library is heavily influenced by two other libraries and wouldn't be
possible without them:

1. [`quilljs/delta`](https://github.com/quilljs/delta) - original JS library for
   rich text OT. Entire public API of `text_delta` is based upod it.
2. [`jclem/ot_ex`](https://github.com/jclem/ot_ex) - implementation of this
   library is heavily influenced by `ot_ex`. Though this library pursues
   slightly different design goals than `ot_ex`, it wouldn't be possible without
   it.

## Differences from `ot_ex`

If you are searching for a library matching Quill's Delta format on the server
side, this library is pretty much a direct match. If, however, you're looking
for a more general Operational Transformation library, you should
consider both `text_delta` and `ot_ex`. Here are the key differences from
`ot_ex` that might help you make the decision:

1. `text_delta` is heavily based on Quill Delta. That includes the public API
    and the delta format itself. This results in a more verbose format than
    `ot_ex`.
2. `ot_ex` uses fully reversible operations format, while `text_delta` is a
   one-way. If reversibility is a must, `ot_ex` is your only option.
3. `text_delta` allows arbitrary attributes to be attached to `insert` or
   `retain` operations. This allows you to transform rich text alongside plain.
   With `ot_ex` you pretty much stuck with plain text format, which might not be
   a big deal if your format of choice is something like Markdown.

## Installation

TextDelta can be installed by adding `text_delta` to your list of dependencies
in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:text_delta, git: "https://github.com/MeisterLabs/text_delta", tag: "v1.7.1"}]
end
```

## Testing & Linting

This library is test-driven. In order to run tests, execute:

```bash
$> mix test
```
